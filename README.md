# SE 1A Tiva Board Project  

## Overview  
For our final SE project in our 1A term, we decided to make a rhythm game involving the Tiva-C LaunchPad TM4C123G and the Orbit OLED BoosterPack. The full features we wanted to integrate in the game are described in the TivaProjectProposal.pdf . The "complete" project can be found in the testRuns folder (originally meant to be only test runs, hence the name). The project is coded in C, as that was the language we were learning at the time.

## Features  
Upon running the program, there is a start-up animation with the BoosterPack lights. There is a start screen, a select song screen, a difficulty screen, and finally an in-game UI. Selections are made with the potentiometer and the two input buttons on the BoosterPack. In game, the BoosterPack buttons along with the LaunchPad buttons are used to play the game.

## Plans  
Unfortunately, none of us have a BoosterPack, which makes working on the code harder since we cannot see the results. However, if we do somehow get our hands on one, we will continue working on implementing more features.
